    <h1>Who?</h1>
    <p>Hi all, I'm Mat. I'm a software developer currently based in Sydney, Australia (not Sydney, Nova Scotia), this blog is an attempt to motivate
      myself to actually finish the random projects I set out to do, hopefully with somewhere to showcase it I won't just float from one project to the next.
